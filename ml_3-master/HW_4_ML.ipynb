Она была разработана с целью обеспечения высокой скорости и точности обучения моделей на больших данных, а также устойчивости к переобучению. XGBoost реализует несколько уникальных функций, таких как регуляризация и остановка по раннему прекращению, что позволяет достичь лучшей производительности в задачах машинного обучения. XGBoost является одним из наиболее популярных алгоритмов машинного обучения в настоящее время."
